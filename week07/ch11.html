    </div> 
    <h1>Function Properties and Methods</h1>
    <p>Functions can have properties and methods since they are first-class objects.</p>
    <h2>Call and Apply Methods</h2>
    <p>call() method used to set value of <i>this</i> inside a function to an object provided as first argument. (See console for examples.)</p>
    <p>
        If the function that is called requires parameters, these shlud be provided to the call() function after the first argument. If the function
        doesn't refer to an object as <i>this</i> in its body, it can still be called using call(), but null must be the first argument.
    </p>
    <p>apply() works in a similar way, but the arguments of the function are provided as an array.</p>
    <h2>Custom Properties</h2>
    <p>You can add your own properties to functions just like any other object.</p>
    <h3>Custom properties can be used for memoization, or caching</h3>
    <h1>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h1>
    <p>An IIFE is "an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined" </p>
    <p>This can be done by invoking it (parenthesis at end of function) and making it into an expression by surrounding it in parenthesis</p>
    <h1>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h1>
    <p>By assigning an anonymous function to a variable with the same name as the function, the funciton can define, redefine, and call itself.</p>
    <p>This is the Lazy Definition pattern, helpful when initialization code is required the first time a function is invoked, and subsequent invocations require a new definition.</p>
    <h2>Init-Time Branching</h2>
    <p>Technique used to create functions that rewrite themselves.</p>
    <p>Enables functions to work more effectively in the browser.</p>
    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>Why would one need to use IFFEs?</p>
    <h2>Recursive Functions</h2>
    <p>Function that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. Useful for iterative processes.</p>
    <h1>Callbacks and Promises: see console and examples.js for examples</h1>
    <h2>Async Functions</h1>
    <p>Functions are preceeded by async, and allow asynchronous code to be written synchronously.</p>
    <p>await operator used before function wraps return value in a promise that can be assigned to a variable. The next line of code is not executed until the promise resolves.</p>
    <h2>Generalized Functions</h2>
    <p>See examples.js.</p>
    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <p>References to variables created inside the scope of another function, but is kept alive and used in another part of the program</p>
    <p>
        "One of the key principles in creating closures is that an “inner” function, which
        is declared inside another function, has full access to all of the variables declared
        inside the scope of the function in which it’s declared (the “outer” function)."
    </p>
    <h2>Returning Funcitons</h2>
    <p>
        "A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function,
        maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function."
    </p>
    <h1>Functional Programming</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language (supports procedural, functional, and object oriented programing paradigms)</p>
    <h2>Pure Functions</h2>
    <p>Functional programming uses pure functions. Rules include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Return value should only depend on the values provided as arguments</li>
        <li>There are no side-effects, doesn't change values or data anywhere else.</li>
        <li>Referential transparency, given the same arguments a pure function always returns same value.</li>
    </ul>
