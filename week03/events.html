    <h1>Event Listeners</h1>
    <p>Event listeners are added to elements, are part of DOM. EX: document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);</p>
    <h1>Inline Event Handlers</h1>
    <p>
        Original way of dealing with events. <b>Not recommended for the following reasons:</b><br>
        JavaScript should be kept out of HTML.<br>
        Only one event handler for each event-type can be attached to an element.<br>
        Event handler code hidden away in markup, making identification difficult.<br>
        JavaScript entered as string, making quotes a problem at times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recommended: Use EVENT LISTENERS<br>
        EX: document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);<br>
        Parentheses excluded. If included, function is called when event listener is set.
    </p>
    <h1>The Event Object</h1>
    <p>When event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called.</p>
    <h1>Event Propogation</h1>
    <p>Clicking one event clicks all elements it is nested inside of.</p>
    <p>Event propogation is the order that the events fire on each element. 2 types:</p>
    <p>Bubbling- when event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up document tree firing event on each parent event.</p>
    <p>Capturing starts by firing an event on the root element, then propogates downwards.</p>
