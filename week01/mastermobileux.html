    <h2>Lesson 1, Step 1: How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h2>>
    <p>
        <b>Design for smallest, least powerful device first and you will focus on content.</b> - Joel Marsh<br>
        <b>Whatever you are doing - do mobile first</b> Eric Schmidt<br>
        Responsive does NOT equal moblie first. Design for mobile first. Start small, then scale up. Retrofitting from big to small doesn't work as well.<br>
        <b>Mobile first is not a fad. It is here to stay.</b>
    </p>
    <h2>Lesson 1, Step 2: How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h2>
    <p>
        Observe what users are doing, not always what they are saying.<br>
        Be there, be useful, be quick.<br><br>
        Reachability matters. Needs to be considered across mobile devices. (Smartphone vs tablet, vertical vs horizontal, etc.)<br>
        Speed matters. even a half second delay can cause traffic drops. Networks matter. 4g vs 3g availiabilty.<br>
        Tips:<br>
        &emsp; Reduce image usage. Use SVG/Webfonts, which are lower bandwidth.<br>
        &emsp; Optimize and minify CSS and JS files. Remove empty whitespace.<br>
        &emsp; GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Lesson 1, Step 3: Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h2>
    <p>
        Most commonly used menu items should be located at bottom, most easily reachable area.<br>
        Placement matters. Improve reachability, creates perception of speed, increases satisfaction. <br>
        Hamburger menu vs. "Menu". Just "Menu" wrapped in a box seems more intuitive to most users. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Lesson 1, Step 4: Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h2>
    <p>
        Make it simple so users can use it easily.<br>
        Have labels display inside of fields instead of outside.<br>
        Make inputs large enough to click easily.<br>
        Use <b>float labels.</b><br> 
        Make checkboxes large enough to click with a thumb if possible.<br>
        When needed, paginate forms, rather than creating a long page. (Use progress indicator)<br>
        Enable autocomplete on forms.<br>
        Don't hide password by default, but allow users to do so easily if needed.<br>
        Check out single line input filed for credit card details (by Brad Frost).<br>
        Keyboards matter. Use number pad for number inputs.<br>
        Link phone numbers using anchor tag: \a href="tel:12085555555"\<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Lesson 1, Step 5: Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h2>
    <p>
        DON'T USE POP UPS and POP-OVERS!<br>
        Make ads small and simple. Allow them to grow when clicked.<br>
        Use window between content to show add as scrolling for large ads.<br>
        Users visit websites for content, not ads. Content should always come first. Keep it simple and sleek.<br>
